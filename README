 == Wrong, the wrong content processor ==

What is the right way to generate HTML for blogs, stories or documentation?
Markdown, Textile, Jekyll, plain HTML in Emacs, Sphinx, Haml, RDoc, ...

But sometimes, you don't want to do the right thing.

That's where Wrong enters the picture. Wrong is the wrong content processor,
for any occasion. It generates HTML files from Wrong files, and is geared
towards generating static websites and making awkward jokes in presence of
your girlfriend's parents.

Wrong can generate its own documentation. Run
	$ ./wrong.py -s srcdocs/ -p docs/
and point your favorite web browser to docs/index.html.

The source of the documentation explains it all much better than this readme
could.

Wrong
Title: Introduction

This is the introduction.

#This is a new chapter

But #this isn't.

This is
one
long
(well, not that long)
paragraph.

This & that, & is escaped, as are < and >. If you want a dash--and you do--
two '-'s are all you need. And for a cliffhanger...

Some _emphasis_ is in place (with __).




Empty paragraphs merged.

 

But put in a single space, and merging is prevented. (Although the browser
will still merge it.)

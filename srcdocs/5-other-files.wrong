Wrong
Title: Other files

#Other files
Files in the source directory that can't be processed by Wrong will just be
copied to the publishing directory.

There are two special cases: the CSS file you specify, which may be processed
by CleverCSS before copying, and the home page, which is renamed to
index.html and is templated as specified in “The template”.
